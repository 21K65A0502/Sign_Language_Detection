# Sign Language Detection System 🤟





## Project Overview

The Sign Language Detection System is designed to bridge the communication gap for deaf and hearing-impaired individuals. Using computer vision and deep learning, the system recognizes hand gestures in real-time and converts them into text or speech, enabling seamless communication.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time hand gesture recognition.

- Converts gestures into text or speech.

- Supports multiple sign language alphabets (ASL, ISL, etc.).

- User-friendly interface with live camera feed.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch (optional)

- GUI Tools: Tkinter (optional)

- Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), LSTMs for gesture recognition

## 📥 Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash

git clone <repository-link>

```

Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd Sign-Language-Detection

```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```
## 🎯 Usage

- Connect your camera.

- Launch the program.

- Perform hand gestures in front of the camera.

- The system detects and displays the corresponding text or speech in real-time.

## 📂 Dataset

- Supports public datasets like ASL Alphabet Dataset.

- Custom datasets of hand gestures can also be used for training the model.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Recognize full sentences and complex gestures.

- Multi-language sign support.

- Deploy as a mobile or web app for broader accessibility.

## 💡 Impact

- This system promotes inclusive communication for hearing-impaired individuals and can be used in educational tools, public services, and mobile applications.
