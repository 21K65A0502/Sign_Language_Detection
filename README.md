Sign Language Detection System
Project Overview

The Sign Language Detection System bridges the communication gap between deaf or hearing-impaired individuals and the wider community. The system uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to recognize hand gestures in real-time and convert them into readable text or speech.

Features

Real-time hand gesture detection.

Converts recognized gestures into text or speech.

Supports multiple sign language alphabets (e.g., ASL, ISL).

User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

Tools: Camera for gesture capture, GUI using Tkinter (optional)

Machine Learning Models: CNNs / LSTMs for gesture recognition

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-link>


Navigate to the project directory:

cd Sign-Language-Detection


Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the main program:

python main.py

Usage

Ensure your camera is connected and accessible.

Launch the program.

Perform hand gestures in front of the camera.

The system will detect and display the corresponding text or speech in real-time.

Dataset

The system can be trained on datasets containing images or videos of hand gestures.

Public datasets like ASL Alphabet Dataset or custom datasets can be used for training.

Future Enhancements

Expand support for full sentences and complex phrases.

Add multi-language sign recognition.

Deploy as a mobile or web application for broader accessibility.

Impact

This project improves communication accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals and can be integrated into educational tools, public services, or mobile applications.
